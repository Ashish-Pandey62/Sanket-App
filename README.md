# Sanket-App

**Sanket** is an assistive app designed for the deaf and hard of hearing. It vibrates to alert users when their name or attention-grabbing phrases are detected, identifies who called them and from which direction, and notifies users of critical sounds like fire alarms, sirens, or baby cries. Additionally, it provides context about the sound source, enhancing safety and awareness.
